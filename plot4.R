# This is the answer on Question #4 of Lesson 4 week 3

# File 1 NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
# File 2 SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Question 4: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
# sources changed from 1999-2008?

# The data for this assignment are available from the course web site as a single zip file:
# Data for Peer Assessment [29Mb] download file to work dir
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip

# Load library ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Set variable NEI with data from downloaded RDS file
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

# Set variable SCC with data from donloaded RDS file
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Merge the SCC into NEI in order to select the coal related emissions
# Next time I first select the required columns from SCC as it takes a while
SCC_in_NEI <- merge(NEI, SCC, by="SCC")

# Create a subset of the Coal related emission from SCC_in_NEI
CoalEmission <- subset(SCC_in_NEI, grepl

# The coal related emission is now aggregated by year

# # Create bitmapped format for graphic device in order to plot

# Plot the data with the emissions from coal combustion-related sources.
